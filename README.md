# UDCA-Net: Unsupervised Training of a Dynamic Context-Aware Deep Denoising Framework for Low-dose Fluoroscopic Imaging

This repository contains the PyTorch implementation of a **Two-step unsupervised dynamic context-aware denoising framework based on the recursive filter** for Low-Dose fluoroscopic imaging.

The code is an implementation of the algorithm proposed in the paper, and _it will be uploaded once the paper is accepted._
